"""v4 build — two-tier sandbox profile (M1 isolation layer).

This is the security命门 of the v4 build effort (networking / bash / code-writing).
It builds the macOS ``sandbox-exec`` SBPL profile that enforces Acrab's two-tier
permission model. The kernel-level ``sandbox-exec`` boundary is the *only* real
wall (see ``docs/v4-build-readiness/11-sandbox-impl-plan.md`` §1.5); the legacy
``creative_sandbox_permissions`` AST/argv allowlist is downgraded to advisory
pre-flight for v4 and is intentionally NOT consulted here.

Tier model
----------
* **workspace**  — full read / write / create / modify / delete (``file-write*``).
* **outside workspace** — readable (except credentials) + may CREATE new files
  and directories, but may NOT modify, append, truncate, delete or rename any
  *pre-existing* file. macOS distinguishes a freshly-created vnode from an
  existing one at ``open()``: writing the new vnode is covered by
  ``file-write-create``; touching an existing one needs ``file-write-data`` /
  ``file-write-unlink`` which we never grant outside the workspace.
* **credentials** — neither readable nor writable (defense in depth).
* **network** — denied inside the sandbox by default. Fetch lives on the host
  (``generate_image``-style verb), so injected sandbox code has no exfil path.

Two silent-failure pitfalls this module guards against (empirically hit
2026-06-06, see the impl-plan doc §1.4 / §1.2):

1. ``sandbox-exec`` matches the *canonical, fully symlink-resolved* real path.
   ``/tmp`` is a symlink to ``/private/tmp``; a rule written as ``/tmp`` silently
   never matches. Every path here is ``Path(...).resolve()``-d before it enters
   the profile.
2. SBPL is *last-match-wins*. A credential ``(deny file-read* ...)`` only works
   if it is emitted AFTER the broad ``(allow file-read*)``. Likewise the
   workspace ``file-write*`` rule is emitted LAST so it wins over the broader
   create-only rule for paths that live under ``$HOME``.

NOTE: This module only *builds* the profile and wraps a command. It is NOT yet
wired into the live dispatch path — the v4 verbs (fetch / run_shell / build) are
M3. Correctness is proven by ``tests/test_sandbox_v4_isolation.py``, which is the
rerunnable isolation probe.
