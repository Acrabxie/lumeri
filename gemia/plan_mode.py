"""Plan mode: a per-session read-only planning gate for AgentLoopV3.

While plan mode is ON the model may only inspect state — every tool that
mutates anything (timeline/layer document, media library, annotations,
memory, skills, files), registers a new asset in the session registry, spawns
or pays for generation jobs, exports, or runs arbitrary code is blocked by
the host. The model's deliverable is a concrete plan the user approves; the
client then turns plan mode off and asks for execution.

The allow/block split below was derived by reading every dispatcher
implementation, not from tool names. Notably, several "inspection" tools are
BLOCKED because they register user-visible session assets as a side effect
(``inspect_timeline`` renders a draft export + frame assets, ``extract_frame``
/ ``render_preview`` / ``lumen_render`` / ``lumen_render_range`` /
``lumen_seek`` register derived media, ``lumen_select`` saves the layer doc),
and ``remember`` / ``log_note`` write durable memory files. Planning-quality
inspection stays available through ``get_timeline`` / ``get_lumenframe`` /
``probe_media`` / ``analyze_media`` (whose thumbnail is NOT registered) /
``search_library`` / ``get_media_annotations``.

Fail closed: a tool name in neither set (e.g. a newly added tool nobody
classified yet) is treated as blocked. ``tests/test_plan_mode.py`` asserts
the two sets exactly cover ``TOOL_NAMES`` so a new tool fails loudly there.

## ⚠ PLAN MODE — planning only, no changes

The user switched this session into plan mode. Until they approve a plan:

- You may ONLY inspect and discuss. Available tools: {_ALLOWED_TOOLS_TEXT}.
- EVERY other tool (edits, generation, timeline/layer changes, painting,
  file writes, memory writes, export, build/run_shell) is blocked by the
  host and returns `blocked_by_plan_mode`. Do not call blocked tools —
  plan around them.
- Your deliverable THIS turn is a concrete plan: numbered steps, which tool
  each step uses and its key arguments, the intermediate assets you expect,
  rough cost/time for paid generation steps, and open questions if any.
- While plan mode is on, the "Act — do not instruct" rule is suspended for
  mutating work: presenting the plan IS the successful outcome of the turn.
  Do not apologize for not executing.
- End the turn by presenting the plan and asking the user to approve it via
  the plan-mode controls (or to keep refining it with you). Never busy-wait
  or re-issue blocked calls.
